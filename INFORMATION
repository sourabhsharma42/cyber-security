IP:- or Internet Protocol, is the protocol that is used to define the source and destination IP address of a packet as it traverses the internet. It is often used in conjunction with other protocols such as TCP; hence, the often-used conjunction, TCP/IP.

Protocols :- Protocols are similar. A protocol simply defines a way of communication with all its rules. These rules are usually defined by an RFC (Request for Comments).

The OSI Model from a Cybersecurity Perspective
    1. APPICATIONS - EXPOIT
    2. Presentation - phishing
    3. Session - Hijacking
    4. Transport - reconnaissance
    5. Network - Man-in-the-Middle MiTM
    6. Data Link - SPOOFING
    7. Physical - sniffing

Generic Domains: .com(commercial), .edu(educational), .mil(military), .org(nonprofit organization), .net(similar to commercial) all these are generic domains.
Country Domain: .in (India) .us .uk
Inverse Domain: if we want to know what is the domain name of the website. IP to domain name mapping. So DNS can provide both the mapping for example to find the IP addresses of geeksforgeeks.org then we have to type 
Organization of Domain : parulunivarcity.ac.in

classes based on their network size, range, and purpose. The most commonly discussed IP address classes are A, B, C, D, and E. Each class is defined by the leading bits in the first octet (the first 8 bits) and serves different purposes in network architecture.
A. 1.Range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
   2.Default Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0
B. 1. Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
   2. Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
C
Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
Default Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
D (Multicast)
Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Purpose: Used for multicast groups, where data is sent to multiple hosts simultaneously.

http/3:-
1. HTTP/3 is built on top of the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol, which uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
2. HTTP/3 reduces the time it takes to establish a connection with a server.connection setup into a single process, reducing latency.
3. End-to-End Security: Like HTTPS, HTTP/3 is encrypted by default, ensuring data security and privacy for users.
